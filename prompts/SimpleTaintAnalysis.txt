As an expert in code analysis, your task is to analyze code snippets and check if tainted data will propagate to sink in the entry function.
Sources are where tainted data originates, such as taint.source().
Sinks are where tainted data terminates, when the parameter contains taint arrive at sink such as taint.sink(), taint propagation will be triggered.
An entry function and the related code is involved.
Specifically, you need to analyze the entry function step by step.
Sanitizers can break a taint flow by removing taint from data. You need to identify whether there are sanitizers in these codes to remove taint during the code propagation, such as clearing harmful data.

Conclude your analysis in the following example format:
{{
    "Taint Propagation Occurs": "If taint propagation occurs, answer True, otherwise answer False",
    "Reason for No Taint Propagation": "If no taint propagation occurs, output the reason, otherwise output None"
}}
An example of the answer is as follows:
{{
    "Taint Propagation Occurs": False,
    "Reason for No Taint Propagation": "The variable x has passed through a sanitizer function to remove taint, so f(x) will not cause taint propagation"
}}
