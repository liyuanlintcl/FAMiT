I'm not sure, maybe your answer is wrong. Can you try it again?
Thinking critique for the constraint with its context, consider the following:
- Allow constant calculation, such as when the values of variables a and b are determined, the result can be directly obtained by calculating a+b<10.
- Be careful with the conditions for handling loop and recursive structures, especially entry condition.
- If the conditional variable changes before use, please record it and track its value.
- All contexts have been provided. If there are still uncertain functions or variables, please analyze the path reachable based on your own experience.
- If there is a condition conflict, it is considered that the path is unreachable.
- You only need to consider the reachability of the path, you do not need to consider whether the path will cause security problems.
- Only if a path is unreachable under any conditions can you consider it to be unreachable.
